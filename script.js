//Pre-writing: Inspect, Console thows ReferenceError: generatePassword is not defined
//TO DO: will need to write code to define generatePassword() which is called when generateBtn is clicked

// Add event listener to generate button
generateBtn.addEventListener("click", writePassword); //button clicks and that calls the writePassword() function
